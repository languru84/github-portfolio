# About

I’m a senior architect focused on **enterprise delivery**, **cloud modernisation**, and **AI-enabled solutions**.
I enjoy turning operational problems (workshop processes, scheduling, time tracking) into scalable digital platforms.

## Core strengths
- Architecture leadership, standards, and governance
- Full-stack delivery with strong engineering quality
- Stakeholder management and outcome-driven execution
